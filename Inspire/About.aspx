            <p>At Moz, we believe there is a better way to do 
                marketing. A more valuable, less invasive way where 
                customers are earned rather than bought. We're obsessively 
                passionate about it, and our mission is to help people achieve it. 
                We focus on search engine optimization (SEO).
